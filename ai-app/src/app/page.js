            <span className="pl-16 flex">The prompt is clearly designed in multiple steps, refining the output instructions for the AI. It specifies the [topic], includes constraints for the study plan [duration] and complexity, tailored to a [difficulty] learner. <br />Iterative refinement allows the AI to provide responses that are more aligned with user expectations by breaking the task into manageable and actionable components.</span>

Ensure the plan fits the given time and difficulty level.<br /> 3. Divide the time into structured sessions.<br /> 4. Include actionable tasks for each session.</span>

            <span className="pl-16 flex">The prompt uses explicit constraints, such as specifying the [duration] and matching the [difficulty] level. <br />Contextual constraints narrow the AI's focus, reducing ambiguity and ensuring the response aligns precisely with user expectations. This improves both accuracy and relevance.</span>
